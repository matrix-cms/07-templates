Versions of Jquery stored in this directory will be available in two ways.

1) The latest version will be manually maintained at jquery.js

2) Each version (including the latest) will also be available as a numbered version.
   eg: jquery-1.x.x.min.js
   
Pages that link to (1) will be automatically kept up to date with the latest version.
Pages which require a particular version (2) of jquery can link to it directly.
