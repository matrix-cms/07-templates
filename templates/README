This directory contains dreamweaver templates for variations of the new University of Melbourne Templates.

To use these templates you will also need the directory templates-stuff. The templates-stuff directory contains the images, javascript and stylesheets that make up the actual templates. It also contains a html directory which contains plain HTML versions of the templates and also sample header and footer files that could be used for web applications or SSI's.

/templates-stuff
|-- html
|-- images
|-- includes
|-- js
`-- styles

The templates-stuff directory should be installed in the webserver document root for the templates to function correctly.

The file templates.zip contains both the Dreamweaver templates and the images, styles and html that make up the templates.
This is simply the contents of the directories /templates and /templates-stuff.

Any queries should be directed to: templates@webcentre.unimelb.edu.au
